# Mythesis
In this repository are saved the code scripts of my master thesis: "Natural Language Procesessing in finance: An application based on the FinBERT model".

In my work i analysed many phrases link to the assets BMW and Tesla, extracts from the social network Twitter.
I calculated the sentiment level of every sentence with the NLP model "FinBERT", that can be found at the follow link: https://github.com/ProsusAI/finBERT, and i writed the relative script based on the codes shared by the authors.
I used these information to analyse the correlation between the tweets and the market and try to predict the time series linked to the assets.
For the extraction of the tweets i used Twitter API with R, and i write the relative script starting from the sample code that can be found at the link https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code/blob/main/Full-Archive-Search/full-archive-search.r 

Many details can be found in my thesis.
